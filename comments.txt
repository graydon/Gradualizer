Execution and Proof:
	- generation of Lambda Prolog.
	- generation of Isabelle (with Haskabelle?)

Presentation:
	- generation of Latex
	and in the paper we also ONLY figures from the gradualizer.

It is convenient to generate LambdaProlog code + Ott or Lem. 

Not lambda-calculi typesystem. Session types??
